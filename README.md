## About Me

Nice to see you. Here is a normal girl who is struggling to make herself uncommon.

As a matter of fact, Sherry and Amika are different characters, though we are in the same body now. 

Sherry is a 15-year-old high school girl, who has much more feeling of this extensive world.

Amika is a 13-year-old little girl, who is more concentrated on her important things, with more stable emotion. However, Amika hurt her head in a collision, so she has few word now, with blunter reaction, forgive her please. 

Sherry now focus more in studies and medical help, while Amika is paying more attention to computer science.
