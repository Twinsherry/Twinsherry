## About Me

Nice to see you. Here is a normal girl who is struggling to make herself uncommon.

Here in Github, **Amika** is the **master** of a large proportion of repositories.

My full name is **Shirely Amika**, and you can call me **Amika** The special name has another spelling, **Twinsherry**. 
My birthday is actually not a definite day, but during the days from 1st June to 21st June，so I am a Gemini damsel. Of course I often celebrate that on the last day.

As a matter of fact, Sherry and Amika are different characters, though we are in the same body now. 

Sherry is a 15-year-old high school girl, who has much more feeling of this extensive world. But she is sleeping now.

Amika is a 13-year-old little girl, who is more concentrated on her important things, with more stable emotion. However, Amika hurt her head in a collision, so she has few word now, with blunter reaction, forgive her please.
